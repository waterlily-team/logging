### Contributor Code of Conduct
This code of conduct applies to all individuals who contribute to or interact with the Waterlily community in any official capacity. Should it omit a rule you believe should not be omitted, submit a pull request to the [dotfiles](https://github.com/waterlily-teams/.github) repository; changes will be disseminated from there.

---

#### Standards
As a contributor, you must demonstrate certain standards of behavior in order to maintain the community. You must:

- Remain respectful to those around you in community spaces. The moderation team has zero tolerance for jackassery, and you will be completely banned from public spaces for "ragebaiting".
- Accept responsibility for your mistakes. If you screw up, you screw up. Take it with grace and humility.
- Do not, under any circumstances, create any content using or within official spaces of the project that is illegal in the United States of America. This includes, but is not limited to:
  - Child Pornography or CSAM
  - Content glorifying animal cruelty
  - Doxxing of any capacity

---

#### Enforcement
Community leaders are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any behavior that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

Community leaders have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, and will communicate reasons for moderation decisions upon request, without exception.

Community leaders will be removed should they be deemed unjust or unfit by the community overall. Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior (by moderators or community members) may be reported to the community leaders responsible for enforcement [here](mailto:israfiel_buisness.nearly025@passfwd.com). All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly.

Punishments will be defined on a case-by-case basis. Should the community find a punishment unfair, it will be changed.
